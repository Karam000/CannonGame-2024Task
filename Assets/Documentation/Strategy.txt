* At first I thought I'd use Newton's movement equations, then I noticed they wouldn't fit because 
they take mass into consideration.

* So I thought about the projectile movement approach

* I got the range and time equations for projectile movement but couldn't solve them together to get 
the initial velocity and firing angle (I spent two days solving them ;) )

* All sources I found on the internet suggest having a constant value for at least one of them to get
the other

* Then I came across this tutorial 
https://www.habrador.com/tutorials/unity-realistic-bullets/ 

* It had a guide that helped me determine the initial firing angle and it was of 
great help. It used an equation for initial angle to hit a known point at a known initial velocity

* still I had the problem of not accurate results because I had my initial velocity constant

* So I thought I'd get it from kinematic equations, they don't depend on mass or firing angle

* And that's how I did it :)
